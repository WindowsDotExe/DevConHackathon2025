# **Optimizing Bus Supply and Demand with AI and Computer Vision**

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
Public transportation is often inefficient—some buses run empty while others are overcrowded. Passengers face long wait times, and cities struggle to optimize schedules dynamically.  

## 💡 Our Solution  
We have developed an AI-driven system that **analyzes passenger boarding and drop-off patterns** in real-time using **computer vision and data analytics**. By leveraging cameras installed on buses, we can accurately track the number of passengers getting on and off at different locations.  

## 🔍 How It Works  
### 1. **Real-Time Data Collection**  
- Each bus is equipped with a **camera** that captures passenger movements.  
- The video feed is processed using **computer vision (YOLOv8 + DeepSORT)** to detect and count passengers.  
- The system tags this data with **timestamps and GPS coordinates**.  

### 2. **Predictive Analytics**  
- Using **machine learning (LSTM, XGBoost, or Graph Neural Networks)**, we analyze historical boarding patterns.  
- The model identifies **peak travel times, high-demand stops, and seasonal trends**.  
- This allows us to **predict future passenger flow** with high accuracy.  

### 3. **Dynamic Scheduling & Route Optimization**  
- If demand is high at certain stops, we **increase bus frequency**.  
- If a route sees fewer passengers, the system **reroutes or reduces buses** to save costs.  
- A **real-time dashboard** (built with Power BI/Tableau) helps transit authorities make data-driven decisions.  

## 🌍 Impact & Benefits  
✅ **Reduced Wait Times** – Buses arrive when passengers need them.  
✅ **Optimized Bus Utilization** – No more overcrowding or empty buses.  
✅ **Cost Savings for Transit Authorities** – Fuel and maintenance efficiency.  
✅ **Better Passenger Experience** – Reliable, data-driven transit.  

## 🎯 Why This Matters  
This system **transforms public transportation into a smart, demand-driven network**. Cities can **cut inefficiencies, reduce emissions**, and **enhance urban mobility**—all using AI and computer vision.
